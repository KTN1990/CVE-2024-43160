# Wordpress BerqWP <= 1.7.6 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Uplaod

[CVE-2024-43160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-43160) The BerqWP â€“ Automated All-In-One PageSpeed Optimization Plugin for Core Web Vitals, Cache, CDN, Images, CSS, and JavaScript plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the /api/store_webp.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
